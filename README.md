### Master Generalist Software Engineer

My name is Fang-Pen Lin. I am a Master Generalist Software Engineer. By Master Generalist, it means I am not limiting myself by any particular tool, language or ends. I learn new things quickly, focus on solving the problem, and can leverage different available open source tools to build different ends of software in a vast range of aspects: mobile to web, client to server, development to deployment, single node to cluster and prototype to production. I contribute to open source sometimes. Also write some articles.
