### One Person Army Software Engineer

My name is Fang-Pen Lin. I am a one-person-army software engineer. By one-person-army, it means I am not limiting myself by any particular tool, language or fields. I learn new things quickly, focus on solving the problem, and can leverage different available open source tools to build different ends of software products in a vast range of aspects: mobile to web, client to server, single node to cluster, development to devops, prototype to production and user experience to security. I contribute to open source sometimes. Also write some articles.
